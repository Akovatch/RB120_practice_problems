# # Pet Shelter

# # Consider the following code:

# pudding      = Pet.new('cat', 'Pudding')
# darwin       = Pet.new('bearded dragon', 'Darwin')
# kennedy      = Pet.new('dog', 'Kennedy')
# sweetie      = Pet.new('parakeet', 'Sweetie Pie')
# molly        = Pet.new('dog', 'Molly')
# chester      = Pet.new('fish', 'Chester')

# phanson = Owner.new('P Hanson')
# bholmes = Owner.new('B Holmes')

# shelter = Shelter.new
# shelter.adopt(phanson, butterscotch)
# shelter.adopt(phanson, pudding)
# shelter.adopt(phanson, darwin)
# shelter.adopt(bholmes, kennedy)
# shelter.adopt(bholmes, sweetie)
# shelter.adopt(bholmes, molly)
# shelter.adopt(bholmes, chester)
# shelter.print_adoptions
# puts "#{phanson.name} has #{phanson.number_of_pets} adopted pets."
# puts "#{bholmes.name} has #{bholmes.number_of_pets} adopted pets."

# Write the classes and methods that will be necessary to make this code run, and print the following output:

# P Hanson has adopted the following pets:
# a cat named Butterscotch
# a cat named Pudding
# a bearded dragon named Darwin

# B Holmes has adopted the following pets:
# a dog named Molly
# a parakeet named Sweetie Pie
# a dog named Kennedy
# a fish named Chester

# P Hanson has 3 adopted pets.
# B Holmes has 4 adopted pets.

# The order of the output does not matter, so long as all of the information is presented.
